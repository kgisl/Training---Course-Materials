##About the Course
<p>Interested in learning a computer programming language but unsure of how and where to begin? This course, Learn to Program Using Python, is a great place to start.</p>
<p>Python is an easy and fun language to learn, and it is now one of the most popular programming languages, suitable for almost any task from developing graphical user interfaces to building web applications.</p>
<p>This course is an introduction to the Python programming language. This course is open to all learners who wish to gain an understanding of the basic components of computer programming. You will learn basic computer programming concepts and terminologies such as variables, constants, operators, expressions, conditional statements, loops, and functions. This Python course includes hands-on exercises to help you understand the components of Python programming while incrementally developing more significant programs. The exercises in this course will be based on small assignments which will relate to real-world problems.</p>

##Detailed Course Outline

**An Overview of Python**
<p>Python is currently one of the most popular dynamic programming languages, along with Perl, Tcl, PHP, and newcomer Ruby. Although it is often viewed as a "scripting" language, it is really a general purpose programming language along the lines of Lisp or Smalltalk (as are the others, by the way). Today, Python is used for everything from throw-away scripts to large scalable web servers that provide uninterrupted service 24x7. Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Why Python?
	o	Interpreted languages
	o	Advantages and disadvantages
	o	Downloading and installing

**Running Python Scripts**

<p>This module provides the overview of how run python scripts with differs command. Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Structure of a Python script
	o	Using the interpreter interactively
	o	Running standalone scripts under Unix and Windows

**Getting Started with Python**

<p>The goal of this module is to have you write a simple Hello, World script. By the end of this module, you should be able to identify main parts of an Python.  Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Using variables and Datatype
	o	String types: normal, raw and Unicode
	o	String operators and expressions
	o	Math operators and expressions
	o	Command line parameters
	o	Reading from the keyboard
	o	Build-in String Functions

**Flow Control & Conditional Statements**

<p>In the module we will learn flow and control statement, there has always been a series of statements faithfully executed by Python in exact top-down order. What if you wanted to change the flow of how it works? For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things depending on different situations, such as printing 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending on the time of the day?Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	About Flow Control
	o	The if , Else and elif statements
	o	while loops
	o	Using the for loop
	o	The range() & xrange() function

**Data Structure**

<p>Python has a few built-in data structures. If you are wondering what a data structure is, it is nothing but a way to store data and having particular methods to retrieve or manipulate it. We already encountered lists before; now we will go in some depth. Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	list operations
	o	list methods
	o	Strings are special kinds of lists
	o	tuples
	o	sets
	o	Dictionaries
	o	Built-in functions

**Defining Functions**
<p>we will focus on the user-defined functions in Python. To completely understand the concept, we will learn how they can be implemented by writing code examples. Let’s have a look at other important concepts before jumping into coding. Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Syntax of function definition
	o	Formal parameters
	o	Global versus local variables
	o	Passing parameters and returning values
	o	Built –in functions such as lambda

**Working with Files**

<p>Let's delve into file input and output with normal text files, and later the saving and restoring of instances of classes. (Wow, our lingo power has improved greatly!) Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Text file I/O overview
	o	Opening a text file
	o	Reading text files
	o	Raw (binary) data
	o	Writing to a text file

**Dictionaries and Sets**

<p>We have already become acquainted with lists in the previous chapter. In this module of our  Python course we will present the dictionaries and the operators and methods on dictionaries. Topics in this module includes:</p>

	o	Dictionary overview
	o	Creating dictionaries
	o	Dictionary functions
	o	Fetching keys or values
	o	Testing for existence of elements
	o	Deleting elements

**Errors and Exception Handling**

	o	Dealing with syntax errors	
	o	Exceptions
	o	Handling exceptions with try/except
	o	Cleaning up with finally

**Using Modules**

	o	What is a module?
	o	The import statement
	o	Function aliases
	o	Packages

**Functional programming**

	o	map, reduce, filter
	o	List Comprehensions
	o	High order functions
	o	Immutability

**Regular Expressions**

	o	RE Objects
	o	Pattern matching
	o	Parsing data
	o	Subexpressions
	o	Complex substitutions
	o	RE tips and tricks

**Highlights of the Standard Library**

	o	Working with the operating system
	o	Grabbing web pages
	o	Sending email
	o	Using glob for filename wildcards
	o	math and random
	o	Accessing dates and times with datetime
	o	Working with compressed files
